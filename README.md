# emerpy

This package contains python wrappers of emergent sim packages, using the [gopy](https://github.com/go-python/gopy) system.

NOTE: due to the use of generics in emergent code, and current lack of support thereof in gopy, the python interfaces are not working for current versions.  This will be fixed at some point!
